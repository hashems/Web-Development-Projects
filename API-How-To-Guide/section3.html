		<h1>IP Address-Based Requests</h1>
		<p>
			In the previous section, we looked at how to make location-based requests. Now, let's look at how to make IP address-based requests.
		</p>

		<h2>HTTP GET Requests</h2>
		<p>
			GET requests based on IP addresses also return JSON formatted responses. For these types of requests, use the following URL:
		</p>
		<div>
			<code>
https://worldtimeiodeveloper.p.mashape.com/ip?ipaddress=IP-ADDRESS
			</code>
		</div>
		<p>
			Again, you must use the <code>https</code> request protocol in order to make a request. In this URL, however, <code>IP-ADDRESS</code> should be replaced with the IP address for which you'd like to look up the local time. Here too, there is no API key included in the URL. Reasons for this were discussed in the <a href='section2'>previous section</a>.
		</p>

		<h2>Using Your API Key to Make Requests</h2>
		<p>
			This is another fault in the official documentation, at least for shiny new developers like myself. In order to make calls properly, you must send the following header key-value pair along with URL in the form of: <code>X-Mashape-Key: APIkey</code>
		</p>

		<h3>Error Messages</h3>
		<p>
			Making requests without a valid API key will result in the following 401 Unauthorized error message:
		</p>
		<div>
			<pre>
				<code>
{
  "message":"Missing Mashape application key. Go to http:\/\/docs.mashape.com\/api-keys to learn how to get your API application key."
}
				</code>
			</pre>
		</div>
		<p>
			Making requests with an invalid API key will result in the following 403 Forbidden error message:
		</p>
		<div>
			<pre>
				<code>
{
  message: "Invalid Mashape Key"
}
				</code>
			</pre>
		</div>

		<h2>What's the Time Wherever 52.89.140.99 Is?</h2>
		<p>
			Now, let's look at an IP address-based example. The IP Address above is my own personal public IP address. It is based in a region I do no live, so let's try to figure out the current local time in that part of the world.
		</p>
		<p>
			To do this, we simply substitute the desired IP address (<code>52.89.140.99</code>) to come up with the following URL:
		</p>
		<div>
			<pre>
				<code>
https://worldtimeiodeveloper.p.mashape.com/ip?ipaddress=52.89.140.99
				</code>
			</pre>
		</div>

		<h2>Front End Implementation</h2>
		<p>
			Very similar to the previous example where we made a location-based request, you can use your own front end application to make IP address-based requests. Don't forget to send <code>Content-Type</code> and your API key as request headers. Here is a simple request you can use:
		</p>
		<div>
			<pre>
				<code>
request({
  'url':'https://worldtimeiodeveloper.p.mashape.com/ip?ipaddress=52.89.140.99',
  'method':'GET',
  'headers':{
    'Content-Type':'application/json',
    'X-Mashape-Key':'APIkey'}
}, function(err, response, body){
  if(!err && response.statusCode < 400){
    console.log(body);
  }
  else{
    console.log(response.statusCode);
  }
});
			</code>
			</pre>
		</div>
		<p>
			Again, make sure you use the exact configuration of the string <code>X-Mashape-Key</code> when setting this important and necessary request header, including the quotes!
		</p>

		<h2>Back End Implementation</h2>
		<p>
			Just like in the previous section, you can also test the back end functionality of these requests by using any of the many HTTP request makers online. <a href='https://www.hurl.it/'>Hurl.it</a> is a great tool for doing just this sort of thing. Just like in the previous seciton, select the GET method, copy the URL into the address bar, add the <code>X-Mashape-Key: APIkey</code>, verify that you're not a robot, and hit "Launch Request".
		</p>

		<h2>The Response</h2>
		<p>
			From the above examples, you should get a similar response to the following response:
		</p>
		<div>
			<pre>
				<code>
{
  "version": "1.2",
  "url": "http://worldtime.io/current/WzQ3LjYzNDQsIC0xMjIuMzQyMl18LTEyMi4zNDIyfDQ3LjYzNDQ%3D",
  "location": {
	"region": "United States",
	"latitude": 47.6344,
	"longitude": -122.3422
  },
  "summary": {
	"utc": "2015-11-26 05:58:04",
	"local": "2015-11-25 21:58:04",
	"hasDst": true
  },
  "current": {
	"abbreviation": "PST",
	"description": "Pacific Standard Time",
	"utcOffset": "-8:00",
	"isDst": false,
	"effectiveUntil": "2016-03-13 02:00:00"
  },
  "next": {
	"abbreviation": "PDT",
	"description": "Pacific Daylight Time",
	"utcOffset": "-7:00",
	"isDst": true,
	"effectiveUntil": "2016-11-06 02:00:00"
  }
}
				</code>
			</pre>
		</div>
		<p>
			As you can see, this API makes it very easy to make both types of requests in nearly identical ways.
		</p>

		<h2>Up Next...</h2>
		<p>
			Wow, that was easy! Now, let's move on to parsing the responses we get back from location and IP address-based requests. This is where things will get a little more difficult. Thankfully, the good programmers at World Time Engine have designed this useful tool to return the same type of data for both types of requests.
