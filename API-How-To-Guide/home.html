		<h1>World Time Engine API How-To Guide</h1>
		<p>by Sara Hashem</p>

		<h2>About this Guide</h2>
		<p>Welcome to my How-To Guide for the World Time Engine API.</p>
		<p>
			If you're a world traveler and shiny new programmer like me, you already know juggling multiple time zones at once can be frustrating and confusing. And so can figuring out how to use APIs! Wouldn't it be nice to have immediate access to the current local time information about the current and surrounding time zones with an easy-to-use programmable interface? Imagine all the meetings (and flights) you could schedule with that kind of power!
		</p>
		<p>
			Well, today's your lucky day because I'm here to tell you all about how to use this convenient API in an easy-to-use guide made especially for new programmers like us!
		</p>
		<p>
			The World Time Engine API allows the user access to local time based on longitude and latitude coordinates as well as IP addresses. It's also a great way to access data such as local time in both Universal Time Coordinated and standard local formats, geographical coordinates, and time zone information.
